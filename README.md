## Learning Objectives

<br>

- ü•ö **HTTP**: You can explain these basic notions of the HTTP protocol, the main verbs, headers, ...
- ü•ö **Client/Server Architecture**: You can draw a diagram of your project explaining how the front- and back-ends connect, and can generalize this idea to any web app they use.
- ü•ö **Persistence**: You can explain what persistence is and how it is used in the backend of a web app. You can implement persistence using the backend's file system.
- ü•ö **Postman**: You can use Postman to test and inspect HTTP request/response cycles.
- ü•ö **VSCode Debugger**: You can use breakpoints to pause and step through a Node.js scripts and APIs using the VSCode debugger.
- ü•ö **Promisification**: You can convert built-in node modules from consuming callbacks being `async` functions.
- ü•ö **NPM Modules**: You can find, install, require and use an NPM module in your projects
- ü•ö **Function Roles**: You can explain and apply these 4 function roles in your backend code:
  - _controllers_: like event handlers, but for HTTP requests. (like event handlers in the frontend)
  - _middleware_: do things with a request before it is handled. (no frontend analogy)
  - _data access_: read/write from your data source and return the prepared data, in this module the data source is the file system. (like api calls in the frontend)
  - _logic_: pure functions that transform data and have unit tests. (same as for the frontend)
  - _utils_: functions with side-effects that do one helpful thing. (like procedures in the frontend)
- ü•ö **Express.js**: You can ...
  - listen a new server
  - use middleware
  - `.get`, `.post`, `.put`, `.delete`
  - route params
  - request body
  - send response
  - Express Router
  - static serving
- ü•ö **Entry Points**: You can identify the entry points for your app:
  - _Initialization_: npm scripts, first file, configuration points, server listening
  - _Request/Response Cycle_: first middleware, logging, routes, error handling
- ü•ö **API Documentation**: You can use JSDoc-style comments to document your API, and a documentation script to build API documentation
- üê£ **File System**: You can read, write and append to .txt files. You can can parse, manipulate and re-save data stored in a .json file using the built-in `fs` and `util.promisify` functions.
- üê£ **Data Validation**: You can validate data sent in a request to the backend before saving it to a .json file
- üê£ **RESTful Routes**: You can implement RESTful routes in Express.js, including using the correct `app._` verbs.
- üê£ **Authentication**: You can explain the principles of authentication and can contribute to a group project that has basic authentication
- üê£ **Authentication vs. Authorization**: You can explain the difference and how it is implemented in your projects
- üê£ **Environmental Variables**: You can explain what an environmental variable is, what they're used for, and how they're configured
- üê£ **Backend Configuration**: You can use environmental variables to launch your backend in different modes
- üê• **Asynchronous Callbacks**: You can read, trace and complete simple scripts that use callbacks to work with the file system
- üê• **CI Deployment**: You can set up a deployment for your web apps and connect it to your repository using a CI action so `main`/`master` is always deployed.
- üêî **CLI Apps**: You can complete a simple CLI app that takes user input from the command line and accesses the file system
- üêî **`node-fetch`**: You make API requests from the backend, and use the data in your web apps
- üêî **Testing Routes**: You can explain how tests for API routes work, and can write routes that pass given tests. You can also write tests for a route that already exists.

  - Install [NVM (node version manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
  - Make sure you have the latest Node.js installed (16._._)
  - [The Net Ninja, Introduction to Node.js](https://youtu.be/zb3Qk8SG5Ms)(video, for this week watch at least first 2 lessons or up to 5th, unfortunately lesson 6 about Express is outdated due to the new version of Express, where some methods were deprecated)
- **[Postman](https://www.postman.com/)**: install it and make an API request
   -[Postman tutorial](https://youtu.be/VywxIQ2ZXw4) (video, you need only first half 'Unit 1')
-**Express**
  - [What is Express?](https://www.besanttechnologies.com/what-is-expressjs)(article)
  - [LearnWebCode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7ikpQCWbtQ)(video)

  - [David Connelly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pov477mI57A) (video)
- Read and run [./example-apps/storage-server](./example-apps/storage-server)
  - You do not need to understand everything, just enough that it's not totally new.

### Lesson Plan

#### Before Break

- What are servers? What's a server-client architecture?
- What is NodeJS?
- How can we use the Expressjs library to build servers on NodeJs?
- What's the difference between static and dynamic data?
- How can we serve simple static data? (route params, query params, static-server)
- HTTP Methods (Verbs)

#### After Break

- Walkthrough of a starter-project where one path has been fully implemented
- Class project: implement the missing path

### After Class

No project! There's enough to study without one ;)

If you want to begin preparing for the _group project in Week 3_ you can begin experimenting with the [Web Apps Starter Repo]()

- Using middleware
  - Logging
  - Validation
