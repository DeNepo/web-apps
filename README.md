#### `restful-courses` (project)

> Group Project, [Code-Along](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/homework-submission/#projects)

This week's project is to follow the [Build RESTful APIs with Node and Express](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKd0Rpw7O48) by Mosh. Besides just Express and writing RESTful routes you will learn how to use _JSON schemas_, test your API's with _Postman_, use _environmental variables-, and practice continuous development using \_nodemon_.

Don't worry if you don't understand everything in this project. The tutorial covers a lot of material very quickly, we'll spend the next weeks going deeper into the topics Mosh covers here. Think of this week's project as a sneak preview of the coming 3 weeks.

Just copying his code is not all! After finishing with the tutorial you will need to refactor the code so that It reads and writes from a file called `courses.json` instead of using a local variable. ie:

1. ```js
   app.post('/api/courses', (req, res) => {
     const { error } = validateCourse(req.body);
     if (error) return res.status(400).send(error.details[0].message);
     const course = {
       id: courses.length + 1,
       name: req.body.name,
     };
     courses.push(course);
     res.send(course);
   });
   ```
1. ```js
   // there are some mistakes in this, we can't give it all away ;)
   app.post('/api/courses', (req, res) => {
     const { error } = validateCourse(req.body);
     if (error) {
       return res.status(400).send(error.details[0].message);
     }
     fs.writeFile(COURSES_PATH, (err, content) => {
       if (err) {
         res.status(500).send(err.message);
         return;
       }
       const parsedCourses = JSON.stringify(content);
       const course = {
         id: courses.length + 1,
         name: req.body.name,
       };
       parsedCourses.push(course);
       const stringifiedCourses = JSON.parse(parsedCourses, null, '  ');
       fs.readFile(COURSES_PATH, parsedCourses, err => {
         if (err) {
           res.status(500).send(err.message);
           return;
         }
         res.send(course);
       });
     });
   });
   ```

And here's a suggestion for how to organize your `courses.json` file:

```json
{
  "nextId": 3,
  "courses": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "name": "x-ray"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "gamma-ray"
    }
  ]
}
```

You will be expected to turn in your code from his tutorial on a new repository called `restful-courses`. you will be assessed not only on your live demo, but also on the quality of your code, the correctness of your branches, the organization of your code, and the completeness of your README. Your repo must include:

### During Class

#### Before Break

Practice refactoring small Express apps from single-file servers into multiple files using `express.Router()`.

- all together: [Class Slides](./slides/3-class.html)
- in groups: [10-refactoring-apis](./examples-and-exercises/10-refactoring-apis)

#### After Break

  - examples: all together
  - exercises: in groups

### After Class

#### Practice Project

It's not required, but it will help. Revisit the text editor app you studied last week, this time refactoring the server from a single file to the same folder structure as the exercises. The code in this repo works! Your job is to make sure it _still_ works after you've refactored it :)

- [textidor-refactor](./practice-projects/3-textidor-refactor)

#### Project

- [the `courses-web-app` template repo](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/courses-web-app) (Group Project)

Again with the refactors?! This week's project is refactor the API from [Build RESTful APIs with Node and Express](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKd0Rpw7O48) into a full web app. To help you get started, you can use [the `courses-web-app` template repo](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/courses-web-app).

Besides refactoring the backend into multiple files, you are also expected to develope a frontend for your API in the `/client` directory. You can design the frontend however you like, and organize the code in a way that makes sense to you. The main objective this week is to understand how the frontend & backend are related.

## Week 4

- JSON Schemas
- Schema Validation
- Adding a `schema.json` file to your projects

<details>
<summary>expand/collapse</summary>

### Before Class

- [slides](./slides/4-prep.html)
- videos: [Part 1](https://vimeo.com/420678014), [Part 2](https://vimeo.com/422487341)
- Examples: [12-data-validation](./examples-and-exercises/12-data-validation)

  - [jsonschemavalidator.net](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/) (used in the prep videos)
  - [tv4 validation library](https://github.com/geraintluff/tv4) (prep video and your projects)

### During Class

#### Before Break

Practice using JSON Schemas & `tv4` to protect data saved in a .json file.

- all together: [Class Slides](./slides/4-class.html)
- in groups: [12-data-validation/exercises/1-write-data](./examples-and-exercises/12-data-validation/exercises/)

#### After break

- in groups: [2-write-data & 3-write-handlers](./examples-and-exercises/12-data-validation/exercises/)

### After Class

#### Practice Project

It's not required, but it will help. Build a simple _virtual file system_ using a .json data file and schema. This API is very similar to the one you studied the last two weeks, but instead of reading and writing actual files it stores file names and text contents as entries in a single .json file.

- [textidor-validated](./practice-projects/4-textidor-validated)

#### Project

**impress yourselves!** (Group Project)

This week's project is open-ended. Starting with the [tv4-validation-fs-template](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/tv4-validation-fs-template), build a project to impress yourself. You've been at HYF for a few months now and every week your projects have been given to you. You've hopefully learned about planning the steps of your projects, organizing your code, and writing clean code. It's time to put yourself to the test.

Here are some tips to help you find your way:

1. _start with your user_ Begin by identifying the type of person who will want ot use your app, and why they would want to use it. Who is this project for? What does the app do for them? Why is this helpful?
2. _define your data_ Before you start coding, understand the data your application will be using. This includes writing the schema and creating some starter data by hand.
3. _write your backend first_ After defining your data, write an API that allows users to create, read, update, and delete entries in your data file(s).
