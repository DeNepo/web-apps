# Writing Routes

This project starts a web server at port 3000 but handles no requests as no routes are defined for it.

Your goal is add routes and controllers such that a user can access data for any of the people who have their data stored under the `data` directory by providing the name as a route param.

You'll have to design the routes yourself, hook them up to the controllers and then import and use the data access methods from `data-access.js` module in your controllers.
