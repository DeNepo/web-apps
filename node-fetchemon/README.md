# Node Fetchemon

There is more than one way to make API request from Node.js, you'll be learning `node-fetch` so you can directly transfer everything you learned about API calls in the Browser.

## Getting Started

* Clone the repo
* `npm install`

## Learning Objectives

* Using the [node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) package
* Exploring APIs ([PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/))
* Understanding existing code
* Async/await vs. standard Promises
* Using the native Node.js [assert](https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html) module
* Logging & debugging async code in Node.js

## Studying the Exercise

Each exercise generates it's own report file, these are helpful for you to study and your coaches to review your work.

To generate these files, each exercise has ~30 lines of boilerplate code.  This code is the same in each exercise.  Take some time to study this code and understand how it generates the report files.  While you aren't expected to write code like this yourself, it is understandable!

## Example Project to Study

_Weather-it_: an example CLI app that calls _api.weatherapi.com_

* [async/await](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/web-apps/tree/staging/integrate/weather-it-async-await)
