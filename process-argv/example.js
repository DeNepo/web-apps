// let's get started

// Command Line Arguments are arguments you pass to your program at runtime.
// It is data the program receives from outside itself.


// process.argv is an array where the program stores these arguments for you to use
console.log('all args')
console.log(Array.isArray(process.argv))
console.log(process.argv)

// You'll notice the first 2 arguments are special.
// They are always present, even if you don't provide any arguments.
// These arguments can be used by the program to know how and from where
// it was run. What it can do with this information is currently out of scope
// but have a look at this excellent _____ to get a better idea.
// Right now we'll always start reading from the 3rd argument onwards.


// process.argv is an "array-like" object. It's not exactly an array
// but we can call certain methods on it like `slice`. Here we're getting all
// elements from the 3rd element onwards
const userProvidedArgs = process.argv.slice(2)

console.log('user args')
console.log(userProvidedArgs)

// run this program with different args and different number of args
// (yes, there can be more than one!) to see the output change.


// now let's try to make our program say "Hello!" to someone.

const name = userProvidedArgs[0]
console.assert(typeof name === 'string', 'command line arguments are always strings!');

// but wait! what if the user didn't provide any arguments?
// That could be an error and we should check for it.

if (!name) {
  console.log(`Can't say hello, you did not give me a name üôÅÔ∏è`)
  process.exit(1)
}

console.log(`Hello ${name}! ü§ó`)
