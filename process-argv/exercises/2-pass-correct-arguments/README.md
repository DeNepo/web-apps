This folder contains three files

- `listify.js`: a function exported for use in other files (logic)
- `test.js`: a file containing tests for the function in `listify.js`
- `index.js`: a simple Command Line Interface for using the function in `listify.js` (handler)

---

You do not need to write any code for this exercise, just to practice using these files.

`index.js` contains 1 test, your task is to pass in the command line arguments that will pass the test.
