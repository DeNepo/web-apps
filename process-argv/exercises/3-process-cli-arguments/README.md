This folder contains four files

- `repeater.js`: a function exported for use in other files (logic)
- `test.js`: a file containing tests for the function in `repeater.js`
- `index.js`: a simple Command Line Interface for using the function in `listify.js` (handler)
- `index-demo.js`: a file you can run to see the expected behavior of your `index.js`

---

you will need to write `index.js`, correctly processing the user input before passing it to the `repeater` function and logging the result.

_challenge: what would you pass in the terminal to log 6 empty lines?_
