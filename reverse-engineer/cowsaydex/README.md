## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
1. `cd` into the project
1. `npm install`

---

## Learning Objectives

* Processing and using CLI arguments with `process.argv`
* Writing to the file system
* Structuring and using CLI apps
* Reverse-engineering
* Using NPM packages (piuccio/cowsay: [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cowsay), [GitHub](https://github.com/piuccio/cowsay))
  * Reading documentation
  * Building projects around modules

---

## Running the Demo

This repo comes with a fully-functioning (but unreadable!) demo.  Play with this demo for a while to make sure you understand how your `cowsaydex` should behave.

* `node demo.min.js -h`

## Complete the Exercise

`index.js` contains starter code that _almost_ entirely works.  There are three tasks for you to complete:

1. __Process User Input__: Create an array containing all of (and only!) the command line arguments passed by the user
1. __Generate the `userConfig` object__: Convert the array of user arguments (all strings) into a config object describing the new cowsay
1. __Write the cowsay to a file__: Using the constant `COWSAID_DIRNAME` and the config option `.file`, write the generated cowsay to the user's file system
