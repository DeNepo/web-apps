# Textidor Refactor

This fun little project is a fullstack text editor. From the frontend a user can:

- Get a list of all saved files
- Create a new file
- Edit an existing file
- Delete an existing file

This is an in-class project from the _web-apps_ module, check out [the module repo](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/web-apps/tree/master/isolate) for some practice problems before diving right in.

## The Setup

1. Clone the repo
1. `cd` into the project
1. `npm install`

---

## Learning Objectives

- Refactoring single-file servers into a folder structure

---

## Your Task

All of the code works!  Your task is to refactor the routes from the main `index.js` file into the `/api` directory following the same refactor pattern you studied in [these examples and exercises](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/web-apps/tree/master/isolate).

You'll know you're done when nothing has changed ... from the user's perspective :)  This exercise is all about developer experience and maintainable/testable code bases.

## Challenge

All done and looking for a little extra? Refactor your code to use `async/await`
