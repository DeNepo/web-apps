## Lesson Plan

> [Lesson Plan Slides](https://hackyourfuture.be/module-name/week-3)

Practice refactoring small Express apps from single-file servers into multiple files using `express.Router()`.

### Isolate

These exercises have a server running from a single file (`index.js`), your task is to refactor them to match the file structure in the examples. Bonust points: convert all callback and promise code that you see into async/await.

- Exercises
  - [param/query/body](../isolate/refactored-exercise-param-query-body)
  - [`fs`: error middleware](../isolate/refactored-exercise-fs-error-middleware)
  - [`fs`: param/query/body](../isolate/refactored-exercise-fs-param-query-body)
- Examples
  - [dynamic server](../isolate/refactored-example-dynamic)
  - [params/query/body](../isolate/refactored-example-param-query-body)

### Integrate

Revisit the text editor app you studied last week, this time refactoring the server from a single file to the same folder structure as the exercises. The code in this repo works!  Your job is to make sure it _still_ works after you've refactored it :)

## Assignments

### Suggested Study

- [Traversy Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L72fhGm1tfE)

### Exercises

- [node-practice-replace](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/node-practice-replace)

### Project

#### `courses-web-app`

- [the `courses-web-app` template repo](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/courses-web-app)

Again with the refactors?! This week's project is refactor the API from [Build RESTful APIs with Node and Express](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKd0Rpw7O48) into a full web app. To help you get started, you can use [the `courses-web-app` template repo](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/courses-web-app).

Besides refactoring the backend into multiple files, you are also expected to develope a frontend for your API in the `/client` directory.  You can design the frontend however you like, and organize the code in a way that makes sense to you.  The main objective this week is to understand how the frontend & backend are related.

Your repo must include:

- A `development-strategy.md` file to explain how you built the app in small pieces (this file doesn't need to match the tutorial!)
- One branch per step in your `development-strategy.md`
- A complete README.md
- A working frontend in the `/client` directory

#### Challenge: Deployment

Deploying you project is not required, but is suggested.  This is a nice first project to try out fullstack deployment.
